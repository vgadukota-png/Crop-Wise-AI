📌 Abstract
AgriGuard AI is an intelligent, farmer-centric web application designed to provide early pest outbreak warnings and AI-based crop disease detection. The platform combines machine learning, multilingual voice support, and community intelligence sharing to help farmers take timely preventive action. It is built as a lightweight prototype using Base44 to demonstrate real-world agricultural impact.

🚨 Problem Statement
Farmers frequently suffer crop losses due to:
•	Late detection of pest outbreaks
•	Lack of real-time localized alerts
•	Difficulty identifying crop diseases
•	Language and literacy barriers
•	Poor information sharing between farmers
Most existing solutions are either too technical, not localized, or not accessible to small and rural farmers.
